# Streaming Churn Prediction Project

Welcome to the Streaming Churn Prediction Project! This project aims to predict customer churn in a streaming service using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression and decision trees. Churn prediction plays a crucial role in subscription-based businesses, enabling proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Overview

The core objective of this project is to develop predictive models that anticipate customer churn in a streaming service environment. Churn prediction is a critical task for subscription-based businesses, as it enables timely identification of at-risk customers and intervention strategies to retain them. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms, specifically logistic regression and decision trees, we aim to uncover actionable insights from streaming data to enhance customer retention efforts.
The individual folders contain code and documentation for the model implementation and evaluation of both algorithms.
